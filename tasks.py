"""
Simple law tasks that demonstrate how to build up a task tree with some outputs and dependencies.

The first task (FetchLoremIpsum) will download 1 of 6 different versions of a "lorem ipsum" text.
The next task (CountChars) determines and saves the frequency of every character in a json file.
After that, the count files are merged (MergeCounts). The last task (ShowFrequencies) illustrates
the "measured" frequencies and prints the result which is also sent as a message to the scheduler.
